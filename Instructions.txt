The labs workspace includes folders for the start and end state of relevant modules in the course.

In the terminal window at the bottom of the lab workspace you can use various commands to navigate the folders and start or stop the apps.

Helpful Commands:
dir: View the contents of the current directory
cd: Change directory to navigate folders
dotnet run --project <chosen-project>: Can be used to start the app

The UI and API projects both need to be running for the app to start properly.  An example workflow can be seen below:

In the terminal window:
cd M03/start
dotnet run --project WiredBrainCoffee.UI

Wait for the project to launch, and then refresh the browser on the right to see the UI load.
Next, open a second terminal window by pressing the + button next to the Terminal tab.

In the new terminal window:
cd M03/start
dotnet run --project WiredBrainCoffee.API

You should now be able to navigate between different pages of the Coffee Shop app, and data should loan from the API.

Helpful tips:
You can use ctrl + c to stop a project that is running in the terminal.
Wait for one project to finish starting before launching another
After navigating to the correct directory, the run button in the bottom right of the terminal can be used as a shortcut to launch the UI project
